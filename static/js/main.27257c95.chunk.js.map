Everyone has a website these days, right?? So on this website, I will be showcasing various projects I'm working on, as well as completed projects.</p>\n      <p>As a side note, I currently reside in the good ole' state of Kentucky. I work as a production worker and have loved technology/computing my entire life! This is just a small introduction, head on down to my 'About Me' section to learn more about myself! Have a great day =)!</p>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n  <div className=\"aboutMe\">\n  <div className=\"group\">\n    <div className=\"item\">\n  <h2 style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>About Me</h2>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Coding has always been an interesting thing to me. My love of computers started when I was around 3-4 years old. Back then, in the mid-nineties, computers were on the rise, my father was interested in computers within the early years of the nineties. Here and there I had been able to gain a glimpse into what computers could do for people and the world in general. This made me beg my parents to get me a computer when I was super young, and to my surprise, they did! I wasn't allowed to be on the internet too much since I was so young, so I mostly stuck to playing computer games like Sonic the Hedgehog and other games such as that. But from then on, computers became this wonderous thing in my life!</p>\n\n  <p>In recent years, (1-2), I have become interested in coding and the deeper infrastructures on computers. I wanted to know what made them tick, and how I could learn what those things were and use them to further my understanding of computers. I love discovering new things and picking apart puzzles to figure out how things work and how to better them! I know I'm still in the beginning stages of my progression, but I can't wait to see how technology advances and how I can further learn and help in the development of the future. Things such as front-end development, as well as the trickiness of back-end development are some of the things that I want to help with going forward. Working by myself or with a team of talented individuals to come up with various Javascript scripts to help output things on a front-end to better the customer experience. This is the future for me!</p>\n\n  <p>When I'm not coding and I have free time away from my job, I enjoy playing video games, such as Rocket League, Hearthstone, Valorant, etc. I also enjoy journaling and writing poetry from time to time to take my mind away from the world! I try my best to live as relaxed and at ease as possible, adopting some of the Buddhist teachings to try and consistently keep a level and a clear head in my daily life. Meditation I have found does wonder for the brain and can help keep your soul connected to yourself and to the Earth that we're living on.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n  <div className=\"portfolio\">\n  <div className=\"group\">\n    <div className=\"item\">\n      <h2>Portfolio</h2>\n      <hr />\n      <img src={firstWebsite} alt=\"First website project I created\" className=\"image-enhanced-2\" />\n      \n      <a href=\"https://dchane06.github.io/Project-Website-Portfolio/\" target=\"_blank\">First Website Project!</a>\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/Dchane06/Website-Portfolio-Project\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Repo</a>\n\n      \n      <p>This was my first website project attempt that I did as an assignment for the coding Bootcamp Thinkful.
